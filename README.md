# PNG_ImageViewer
Image Viewer for PNG image format (Not for every png image)<br>
Possible future implementations for : <br>
Grayscale - 1-bit image<br>
TrueColor - 8-bit image<br>
IndexedColor - 8-bit image<br>
TrueColor with alpha channeling : 8-bit image<br>
<br>
The aim is to build a working image viewer with above supported png images using Qt or OpenGL.
<br>
<br>
/src contains deflate.c (decompressor) and image.c (filter reverser).
<br>
image.c returns stream of data and used by Qt to render image.<br>
image.c and deflate.c are converted to their respective object files. So the line, <br>
OBJECTS += deflate.o image.o <br>
is mandatory to be included while building Qt project.<br>
C is called from C++ with the help of extern "C" block and linked with object files generated by gcc. <br>
